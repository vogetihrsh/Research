#if you don't have binary version of Control-FREEC, you need to compile it. Go the directory with Control-FREEC source files and type

make

#go to the directory with the data and the config file.

#run Control-FREEC:

PATH_TO_FREEC/freec -conf config_chr19.txt
*** you can find freeC executable file in PROJECT/Project/ControlFreeC folder 

#If you have problems than you probably need to modify the paths to input files in the config file. 
#You can read about how to create your own config at http://bioinfo-out.curie.fr/projects/freec/tutorial.html#CONFIG
